My name is Luke, I love trainhopping and adventures. On this website you will find my blogs about each trip/adventure. And any info about locations, etc and the gear I use.

I am from Serbia and I'm 18 years old. I have been trainhopping for about 2 years. My first journey was 100km, in a gondola filled with stone. I was accompanied by my friend [@vexel](https://www.youtube.com/@vexelfreedom).

I was inspired by [@shiey](https://www.youtube.com/@shiey), so I hope you don't mind the simliar editing style.
